# GBM PDX STR Similarity Search Tool

This web tool provides you with the ability to search for Short Tandem Repeat (STR) similarity between your sample (query) to the glioblastoma (GBM) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors present at UAB. This tool is inspired by the [Cellosaurus CLASTR search tool](https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus-str-search/).

## Purpose

To enable improved tracking of tumor line identity and provide collaborators to quickly confirm matching of their specimens/tumors/cells with existing PDX models
