# GBM PDX STR Similarity Search Tool
___

This web tool provides you with the ability to search for Short Tandem Repeat (STR) similarity between your sample (query) to the glioblastoma (GBM) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors present at UAB. This tool is inspired by the [Cellosaurus CLASTR search tool](https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus-str-search/). Additional information about this resource can be found at <https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.32639>.

### Purpose

To enable improved tracking of tumor line identity and provide collaborators to quickly confirm matching of their specimens/tumors/cells with existing PDX models.

### Reference set

The reference set of GBM PDX tumors include the following:
