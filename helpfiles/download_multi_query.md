### Download detailed multi-query results
___

To view __detailed results__ for each query and STR marker (as shown in the single-query options), please download the results from the `Download multi-query detailed results` icon. 

This option is enabled once an upload has been performed by the user, and it will return a file named `GBM_PDX_STR_multi_query.xlsx` where each query result is split into separate tab of the Excel file.

The table shown in the app is a summarized version of this data displaying the score for each STR per sample.
