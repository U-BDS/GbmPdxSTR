### STR data entry
___

You may enter STR data via the manual entry below or by uploading a csv file containing STR data (please check the format of this file by reading the upload CSV file of single-query data helper)

A few points on data entry for STR markers:

* If you do not have data for a specific STR, you can leave it blank or type `NA`
* Higher confidence scores are generated by the inclusion of as many STR loci as possible. Thus, a decrease in the accuracy of STR profiles are expected with low loci number - we __strongly discourage__ use of low number of STRs.
* Note that homozygous alleles are counted as one allele - e.g.: `10,10` entry will be recorded as `10` ; this follows the same methodology present in the CLASTR app and the CLASTR paper (see more at: <https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.32639>)
